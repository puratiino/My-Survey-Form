I Build a Survey Form, which was needed on the<strong><p style="background-color:powderblue;"> freecodecamp </p></strong>page to do.
This form was to contain:<br>
User Story #1: I can see a title with<strong> id="title"</strong> in<strong> H1</strong> sized text.

User Story #2: I can see a short explanation with<strong> id="description"</strong> in<strong> P </strong>sized text.

User Story #3: I can see a form with <strong>id="survey-form"</strong>.

User Story #4: Inside the form element, I am required to enter my name in a field with <strong> id="name"</strong>.

User Story #5: Inside the form element, I am required to enter an email in a field with <strong>id="email"</strong>.

User Story #6: If I enter an email that is not formatted correctly, I will see an <strong>HTML5</strong> validation error.

User Story #7: Inside the form, I can enter a number in a field with<strong> id="number"</strong>.

User Story #8: If I enter non-numbers in the number input, I will see an <strong>HTML5 </strong>validation error.

User Story #9: If I enter numbers outside the range of the number input, which are defined by the min and max attributes, I will see an<strong> HTML5</strong> validation error.

User Story #10: For the name, email, and number input fields inside the form I can see corresponding labels that describe the purpose of each field with the following ids:<strong> id="name-label", id="email-label",</strong> and <strong> id="number-label"</strong>.

User Story #11: For the name, email, and number input fields, I can see<strong> placeholder text</strong> that gives me a description or instructions for each field.

User Story #12: Inside the form element, I can select an option from a<strong> dropdown </strong>that has a corresponding<strong> id="dropdown"</strong>.

User Story #13: Inside the form element, I can select a field from one or more groups of<strong> radio buttons</strong>. Each group should be grouped using the name attribute.

User Story #14: Inside the form element, I can select several fields from a series of<strong> checkboxes</strong>, each of which must have a value attribute.

User Story #15: Inside the form element, I am presented with a textarea at the end for additional comments.

User Story #16: Inside the form element, I am presented with a button with<strong> id="submit"</strong> to submit all my inputs.
<h3>And finally the page had to pass a test, which it also passed.</h3>
Simple.... Right :)
